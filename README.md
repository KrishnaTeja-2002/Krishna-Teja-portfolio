## 🚀 How to Run Locally

You’ll need **Node.js** & **npm** installed.  
[Install Node.js using nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) if you don’t already have it.

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Go into the project folder
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in the terminal).
